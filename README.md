# personal_website

This repository contains my personal website. The intention is to give potential employers an introduction to me and my achievements. It will contain 3 pages: Home, About, and Portfolio. This will be done using 3 HTML files, a style sheet in CSS, and a JavaScript file to make the site functional.

The GitHub project titled "Personal Website Project" will be used to track my goals and progress. To-do items include: creating the 5 files needed; creating multiple branches with descriptive commit messages; adding important HTML elements like text and images; styling the pages in CSS; adding a "hello World" script; and double checking the files and cleaning up syntax.
